# MEDifications

> MEDifications is an app developed at [UC Health Hack 2018](https://healthhack.uchealth.edu/#/home). UC Health Hack is an annual interdisciplinary hackathon hosted by UC San Diego Health and members of the University of California’s six health systems. MEDifications is the proof of concept for an application that can utilize RFID technology in a healthcare provider's badge to do 3 things:

When healthcare providers enter a patient's room:

1. The healthcare provider's name auto-populates on an LCD display board, TV and/or iPad for the patient to see. This eliminates the need for the healthcare staff memeber to write their name on the traditional whiteboard.

2. An SMS message is sent to the patient's designated loved notifiying them that a healthcare provider has entered their room. This assures the patient's loved one that they are receiving timely care.

3. A log off all healthcare providers who have entered a room is available for administrators to see who has gone into which room, at a specific date/time. They can use this data to locate (and thereby reduce) the occurance of hospital-acquired infections.

## Background

The theme for this hackathon was Patient Engagement. We were tasked with making a visit to the hospital a more enjoyable, positive, and memorable experience for everyone. Therefore, we set out to make a tech tool that allowed patients to feel empowered in their healthcare journey by providing real-time feedback, increased communication, and data intergration in this new—consumer-driven—healthcare experience.

## Approach

Our goal was to make a proof of concept for our idea as we had a very limited amount of time.
